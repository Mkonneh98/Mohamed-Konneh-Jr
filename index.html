          <p>My goals for the future after college is to become a game level designer or work with some form of creative technology for the game industry. Ever since I had my first PlayStation console (PlayStation all day, baby!) I wanted to be able to create these wonderful works of imagination but I didn’t really know how until I started doing it in high school and even now in college with my own online classes I take to learn the gaming engines. Another goal I have is to be a web developer and work for a popular company like adidas or really anything I stand behind so I can say that the reason they’re website looks nice is because I worked on it!
