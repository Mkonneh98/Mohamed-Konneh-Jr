          <p>Hello, my name is Mohamed Konneh and this is really one of my first design classes for web design. My racial background is Liberian 100% and I am first generation to be born in America. I am excited about this class because I see myself doing this in the future full time because web design seems so fun and you can really be creative with your creations, as well as have a lot of people utilize it. Almost every company has or needs a website that catches the eye, explains information and also is easy to get through. I know sitting at a computer for hours on end is really difficult or boring for some people, but for me sitting there and playing with websites is a great time.
          </p>
  <h2>
    <b>My Hobbies</b>
      </h2>
          <p>My aspirations and dreams for this class is to be able to create a website that I can call my “Portfolio” because a lot of places I want to apply to ask for one and honestly I feel bad that I don’t even have one yet. I would love to be able to post my old artwork and my games that I create and be able to have a place to share my game ideas and other things about me. a resume is great and all but a resume that you can interact with is even better at displaying your skills.
          </p>
  <h3>
    <b>Aspirations</b>
      </h3>
          <p>My goals for the future after college is to become a game level designer or work with some form of creative technology for the game industry. Ever since I had my first PlayStation console (PlayStation all day, baby!) I wanted to be able to create these wonderful works of imagination but I didn’t really know how until I started doing it in high school and even now in college with my own online classes I take to learn the gaming engines. Another goal I have is to be a web developer and work for a popular company like adidas or really anything I stand behind so I can say that the reason they’re website looks nice is because I worked on it!
